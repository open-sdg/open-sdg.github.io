The Open SDG team have been working hard to release Open SDG v1.0.0.

Version 1.0.0 beta is currently being tested by a number of countries, including the UK and Germany. Once the tests have concluded and any issues have been fixed, v1.0.0 will be released in early June.

This version brings a stable base of documentation and functionality, along with a number of visual changes and new features to improve the user-friendliness and flexibility of the platform.

For more information about the v1.0.0 release, check out the [the list of updates](updates.md#100) and for a more technical list of platform changes, see the [change log](changelog.md).
