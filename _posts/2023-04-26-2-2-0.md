Open SDG is an open-source reporting platform for managing and publishing statistics related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is freely available for any country or organization to reuse and can be hosted and maintained using free services.

This month, the Open SDG community launched version 2.2.0, which includes a variety of enhancements and features.

Notable updates include:

* Feature for tagging indicator data as "proxy"
* More granular control over disaggregations on maps
* High-resolution chart image downloads
* SEO improvements: custom meta tags on any page, and custom headings on goal pages
* Design enhancement on reporting status pages - SDG image on overall
* Bugfixes for reporting status label, data edit page, and third-party dependencies

You can view a summary of the updates on our [platform updates page](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/updates/), and a more detailed list in our [2.2.0 release notes](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg/releases/tag/2.2.0).
