Open SDG is an open-source reporting platform for managing and publishing statistics related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is freely available for any country or organization to reuse and can be hosted and maintained using free services.

Notable updates include:

* Major upgrade: remove deprecated code and settings
* Remove support for Internet Explorer
* Disaggregation on maps
* Consistent breadcrumbs across all pages
* Improve support for users without JavaScript
* Design improvements for navigation, tables, search, cards, map legend, and mobile
* Support for referencing site configuration within translations
* Add back-to-top links to goals, indicators, status pages
* Accessibility improvements to indicator tags for better color contrast
